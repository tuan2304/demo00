The tree diagram illustrates the development and distribution of the English language across different geographic regions. Overall, it is clear that British English has influenced most Asian, African, and Australasian countries, while American English is primarily associated with regions in the Western Hemisphere.
American English is divided into two main branches: the USA and Canada. The Canadian branch consists of two varieties—Anglophone Canada and Francophone Canada. In contrast, the USA branch is more diverse, featuring seven subdivisions. Four of these—West Coast, Midwest, Northeast Coast, and Southern—represent regional dialects within the United States. The remaining three—Philippines, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico—are located outside of the mainland US.
In comparison, British English has a broader and more complex structure. The West Indies category includes Jamaican and Barbadian (Barbados) varieties. In the British Isles, the languages represented are Irish, English, Welsh, and Scottish. In Africa, British English influences can be seen in regions such as West Africa, Anglophone Africa, and East Africa. Additionally, the Indian subcontinent is grouped under the label "Forms of Indian English," which includes both Indian and Pakistani variants. The Australasian branch includes English as spoken in Australia and New Zealand. Finally, in the Far East, English has been influenced by or adapted into Malaysian and Chinese linguistic environments.
